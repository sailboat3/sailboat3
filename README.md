# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jack, a high school student that has way too many things to juggle at the same time.

## About me
- I use [Fedora Linux](https://fedoraproject.org/) as my operating system of choice
- When working on Java programs, Android apps, and Minecraft mods, you will find me using [IntelliJ IDEA Community](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community)
- I enjoy using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) to develop games (yes, I use gdscript), more details on the game that we're currently working on soon

## Projects I'm currently working on
- **Koala**: A networking and database manager designed to move data on FRC robots and matches from scouting devices to a central server. Built for team [2046](https://tahomarobotics.org/)
- **Top Secret Game**: Shhhhh

There's probably more but I forgot

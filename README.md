# Welcome! üëã
I'm Jack, a high school student that has way too many things to juggle at the same time.

## About ~~me~~ my programming preferences
- You'll typically find me using Java or Kotlin, but I dabble in other languages as well. Currently I'm using dart only for another project. 
- Catppuccin. 
- Jetbrains IDEs all the way. (Xept for Xcode!! üòù)
- Some form of Linux, I switch between Arch and Fedora way too often. 

## Projects I'm currently working on
- **New [2046](https://tahomarobotics.org/) Scouting App**: Our team wants an app that runs on their phones, so we're rewriting the old scouting app in Dart and Flutter. 
- **[Protocol G](https://x.com/usgprotocolg)** Use guns and tools to creatively navigate your way through an alien-infested, retro-futuristic spaceship hell-bent on destroying Earth!

There's probably more but I forgot

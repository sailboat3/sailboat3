# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jack, a high school student that has way too many things to juggle at the same time.

## Projects I'm currently working on
- **[Beariscope](https://github.com/betterbearmetalcode/beariscope)**: A gamified scouting and analysis app. See trends, view match predictions, and quickly get an overview of a team. 

There's probably more but I forgot
